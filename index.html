        <p>Hi this is Amy's 11ty site!!</p>

                <h3>SSG's Backstory</h3>
                <p>Traditionally, web sites were created by hand with a designer or developer writing HTML.  That process is tedious and time-consuming, as well as prone to errors when large html documents need to be modified for minor changes.  Over the early years of the web, content management systems (CMS’s) were created to help with the problem.  Content management systems generate web pages dynamically based, often, on selections users make.  They take the requests, retrieve data from a database including styles, content, etc., then generate html which is returned to the user for display in their browser.</p>

                <h3>Eleventy Information from Eleventy</h3>
                <p>Eleventy is not a JavaScript framework—that means zero boilerplate client-side JavaScript. We’re thinking long term and opting out of the framework rat race. The tool chain, code conventions, and modules you use in your front end stack are decoupled from this tool. Work from a solid foundation of pre-rendered templates that suit your project’s progressive enhancement baseline requirements.</p>

                <h3>About Static Sites from Eleventy</h3>
                <p>A static site is a group of generated HTML files. Content is built into the HTML files rather than using a dynamic back end language to generate the content on-the-fly. A dynamic site can appear static when you add caching rules to make the content stickier. A static site can appear dynamic when you run your build quickly and often.</p>
